# Chronicles Of Eldoria
## Project Description

This project is based on the development of a game using Agile methodology, Test-Driven Development (TDD), and the implementation of various design patterns to improve code flexibility and reusability. Among the design patterns used are Strategy, Singleton, and Builder. The development process strictly followed Test-Driven Development, applying the red, green, and gray phases to test various parts of the code before integration.

Great emphasis was placed from the beginning on the type of architecture to adopt for the entire system, and finally, the corresponding UML diagram was developed. To run the code and try the game, simply execute the executable with a double click, assuming you have JDK or JRE installed. Alternatively, you can install JDK or JRE, set the environment variables, and run the JAR file from the terminal using the command "java -jar chronicles-of-eldoria.jar".

I hope the game provides enjoyment and that the entire development system, including architecture, UML, and project report, can be helpful for future Agile methodology applications. Further details can be found in the project report uploaded to this repository.

## Story Introduction

The beginning of the game's story is uploaded to the repository as "Incipit - Chronicles of Eldoria.pdf". It is recommended to read it before starting the game for a fair and complete experience.

## Getting Started

To run the game:
- Make sure you have JDK or JRE installed on your system.
- Run the JAR file with a double click or from the terminal using the command "java -jar chronicles-of-eldoria.jar".

Enjoy!
